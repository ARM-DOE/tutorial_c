# tutorial_c

This project includes the source code for the ADI tutorial, written in C.  It provides examples of ADI data 
consolidation and transformation capabilities.  In this example, it combines several heterogenous datastreams into
a single datastream on a unified coordinate grid.
  
This project also includes test data and a Docker container for running, testing, and debugging the code.

Please see the **[docker/README-DOCKER.md](../master/docker/README-DOCKER.md)** file for instructions on how to setup your local container, run, and debug the tutorial code.
